# Cybersecurity Home Lab Documentation

---

## Objective
The goal of this home lab is to simulate real-world cybersecurity scenarios, focusing on configuring and defending against attacks. The lab is designed to build practical skills in threat detection, incident response, and network defense.

---

## Current Setup

### Attack Machine
- **Operating System:** Kali Linux
- **Purpose:** Simulates a malicious actor to test and analyze the defenses of the target systems.
- **Configured Tools:**
  - Basic malware and exploit testing tools.
  - Tools like Metasploit, Nmap, and Netcat.
  - Scripts for brute force, phishing, and privilege escalation simulations.

### Defending Machines
- **Operating System:** Windows 10 (Virtual Machine)
- **Purpose:** Serves as the target for attacks to analyze the system’s behavior under threat.
- **Configured Tools:**
  - **Sysmon (System Monitor):** Installed and configured for event logging.
  - **Splunk:** Installed for log aggregation and real-time analysis. Basic dashboards set up to monitor key events (e.g., login attempts, file changes).

### Networking
- **Configuration:**
  - Private network within the virtualized environment using VirtualBox.
  - Segmented attack and defending machines to emulate real-world network setups.
  - Ensured both machines can communicate securely for controlled testing.

## Planned Enhancements

### Attack Machine Enhancements
- **Tool Expansion:**
  - Add advanced exploitation frameworks like Cobalt Strike.
  - Explore ransomware simulation tools for more diverse attack vectors.
- **Attack Simulations:**
  - Conduct more complex attacks such as SQL injections, cross-site scripting (XSS), and man-in-the-middle attacks.

### Defending Machines Enhancements
- **Log Management:**
  - Refine Sysmon’s configuration to capture more granular data.
  - Set up alerts in Splunk for specific attack signatures.
- **Intrusion Detection System (IDS):**
  - Install and configure Snort or Suricata for real-time intrusion detection.
- **Firewall Configuration:**
  - Implement advanced firewall rules for packet filtering and logging.
- **DNS Sinkhole:**
  - Set up a local DNS sinkhole to redirect malicious domains to a safe environment for monitoring.

### Networking Enhancements
- **VPN Configuration:**
  - Introduce a Virtual Private Network (VPN) for secure remote access to the lab.
- **Segmentation:**
  - Experiment with network segmentation and VLANs for improved isolation.

## Experimentation and Learning Process

### Phase 1: Basic Malware Testing
- **Actions:**
  - Ran basic malware attacks from the Kali Linux machine targeting the defending Windows VM.
  - Analyzed logs generated by Sysmon to identify patterns and behaviors of the malware.
  - Created Splunk dashboards to visualize key events such as file creation, registry modifications, and process executions.

### Phase 2: Enhanced Attack Simulation (Planned)
- **Planned Activities:**
  - Simulate brute-force attacks and analyze logs for anomalies.
  - Test network-based attacks to observe packet-level data using tools like Wireshark.

### Phase 3: Defense Optimization (Planned)
- **Planned Activities:**
  - Customize Splunk’s correlation searches to detect more nuanced threats.
  - Integrate IDS alerts into Splunk for centralized monitoring.
  - Implement endpoint detection tools (e.g., Microsoft Defender ATP) for enhanced protection.

## Challenges and Resolutions

### Challenges Faced
- **Sysmon Configuration:** Initial difficulty setting up Sysmon’s configuration to capture meaningful events.
- **Networking Issues:** Networking misconfigurations caused communication failures between VMs.

### Resolutions
- **Sysmon Configuration:** Referred to official documentation and community forums for guidance.
- **Networking Issues:** Reconfigured virtual network settings to ensure proper communication between machines.

## Future Updates
- **Documentation:**
  - Document specific attack scenarios and their outcomes.
  - Share configurations and logs (sanitized for sensitive information) to GitHub for version tracking and learning.
- **Advanced Techniques:**
  - Explore advanced detection and mitigation techniques such as threat hunting and response workflows.

This documentation will be regularly updated as new components are added, experiments are conducted, and findings are analyzed to ensure a comprehensive learning and skill-building experience. Screenshots will also be added to showcase configurations, attack scenarios, Splunk dashboards, and other key aspects of the lab setup.
